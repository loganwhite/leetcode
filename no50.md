# LeetCode Algorithm Problem Set No.50 -- Pow(x, n) #

## Problem Description ##

>Implement *pow(x, n)*.

## Problem Analysis and Solution ##

### A Simple Approach ###

&nbsp;&nbsp;The simple approach is straightforward, we can simplely have *x* multiply *n* time. However, when I submit this solution, the compiler tell me that the answer for *n* less than 0 is wrong. Actually, I didn't count on *n* could be negtive. So I just calculate the absolute of *-n* and have *1/x* multiply *n* times. However, when the input of n is -2147483648, it will feeds a runtime error back. And when i run it on my machine, it will *core dump*, what happend? I convert -2147483648 into binary form, is 1000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000‬ which is *-2<sup>31</sup>*. But the maximum of int is *2<sup>31</sup> - 1* that means int type can not store 2147483648. This is why *core dump* comes out. How to solve this problem? One solution is to convert the positive number into negtive number as the number of negtive number is larger. Another solution is make -2147483648 plus 2. Why 2? because 2 will not change the parity of -2147483648 and it is small enough to be omitted. The code below is the implementation of this simple solution of *pow(x,n)*.
    
    double pow(double x, int n) {
        double result = 1.0;
        if (n > 0) n = -n;
        if (n < 0) x = 1/x;
        if (n == 0) return 1.0;
        while(n ++) 
            result *= x;
        return result;
    }

### An Optimized Approach ###
&nbsp;&nbsp;The solution above is no doubt **Time Limit Exceeded**. So we have to find a better solution to solve the problem. It's easy to find that *x<sup>n</sup>* is equals to *x<sup>n / 2</sup> × x<sup>n / 2</sup>* if n is even and is equals to *x<sup>n / 2</sup> × x<sup>n / 2</sup> × x* if n is odd. Again, we can use this way to decrease the scale of the big problem into similar smaller ones that is what divide and conquer do. The code below implements in this way.

    double power(double x, int n) {
        if (n == 0) return 1.0;
        double v = power(x, n >> 1);
        return (n % 2) ? v * v * x : v * v;
    }

    double myPow(double x, int n) {
        if (n == -2147483648 ) n = -2147483648+2;
        return (n < 0) ? (power(1.0/x, (-n))) : power(x,n);
    }

## Conclusion ##
&nbsp;&nbsp;This problem seems very easy at the first glance. But it involves many detailed parts. Divide and conquer, the n would be negtive, range of int type. We should take whatever we can count on to solve problems.
