# Maximum Subarray #
## Description ##
> Find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum.<br/>
> 
> For example, given the array [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],<br/>
> the contiguous subarray [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.

## My Solution ##
As I was solving this problem after I knew it can be solved by DP. So the first thing I did is find the best sub-structure. Suppose we have a array of 4 elements. And we define a function d(n) is the maximum of sub-array sums of the whole array. At first, I tried to eliminate the scale of n, say d(n-1), and find the relationship between d(n) and d(n-1). So we may have d(4) = max(d(3), d(3) + A[4]). This is definitely true if we consider the last element only. However, if d(3) is negtive, we should not take the sub-array of previous 3 elements into account. Because this will decrease the summation. So finally, d(n) = A[n] + max(d(n-1), 0). This is so called state transformation equation. With this we can either recursively or iterate from bottom to top to find the result. The later is better which uses constant time.

## Code in C ##
```c
#define max(x, y)  (((x) > (y)) ? (x) : (y))

int maxSubArray(int* nums, int numsSize) {
    int i, j, Max = *nums;
    int *sum_table = malloc(sizeof(int)*numsSize);

    if (numsSize == 1) return *nums;
    sum_table[0] = nums[0];
    for (i = 1; i < numsSize; i++) {
        sum_table[i] = nums[i] + max(sum_table[i-1], 0);
        Max = max(Max, sum_table[i]);
    }

    free(sum_table);
    return Max;
}
```
