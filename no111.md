# Minimum Depth of Binary Tree #
# Description #
> Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.
> The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

# My Solution #
This is a simple binary tree retrieval problem. For each node, we can simply compare the height of left sub-tree and right sub-tree. And the current height is 1 + the minor height. Note that there is a special case is that if a node don't have a left child or right child, the sub-tree height of this node is equal to the height of existing sub-tree.

# Code #
```c
#define min(x,y)    ((x) > (y) ? (y) : (x))

int minDepth(struct TreeNode* root) {
    int left_height, right_height;
    if (!root) return 0;
    left_height = 1 + minDepth(root->left);
    right_height = 1 + minDepth(root->right);
    if (!root->right) return left_height;
    if (!root->left) return right_height;
    return min(left_height,right_height);
}
```
